Abstract

Travel and tourism management system is used to book a tour from anywhere in
the world by a single dynamic website which will help the user to know all about
the places and tour details in a single website. It is a very convenient platform for
travelers to get information and book what they require.

Introduction

I have designed and made a website to make booking travel destinations more
convenient and informative. Our site focuses on various tourist destinations in
India, and offers apt travel packages and plans. Each customer has a unique
account. We have used PHP to store their data.
Our websiteâ€™s structure has been formed using HTML, in a way such that the users
can easily pick any place that they want to travel to. All the pages were designed
through CSS, and the micro interactions have been created using JavaScript.
